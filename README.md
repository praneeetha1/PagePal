## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Document Processing**: Upload your files and PagePal breaks them into manageable chunks  
2. **Embedding Generation**: Text is converted to vector embeddings using SentenceTransformers  
3. **Vector Storage**: Embeddings are stored in Pinecone's vector database  
4. **Semantic Search**: When you ask a question, PagePal finds the most relevant document sections  
5. **Response Generation**: Google's Gemini AI generates responses based on the retrieved context
